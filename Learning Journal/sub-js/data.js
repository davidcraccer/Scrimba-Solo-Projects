        content: `My journey as a front end engineer began with HTML and CSS. 
                At first, I was intimidated by the prospect of building websites from scratch, 
                but as I learned more about these foundational technologies, I grew more confident 
                in my abilities. Through free online resources and YouTube videos, I was able to 
                learn the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, from basic syntax to advanced layout techniques. 
                I discovered the power of creating responsive designs and using CSS to enhance user 
                experience. Now, as a skilled front end developer, I am able to create beautiful and 
                functional websites using these powerful tools.`,

        content: `As I continued my journey as a front end engineer, I knew that I needed to learn JavaScript 
        to take my skills to the next level. But JavaScript can be a challenging language to master, with its 
        complex syntax and powerful capabilities. I turned to free online resources and YouTube videos to 
        learn the basics of the language, and gradually built up my skills over time. From understanding 
        variables and functions to learning about more advanced topics like callbacks and closures, I 
        persevered in my journey to mastery. Now, I am able to use JavaScript to create dynamic and 
        interactive web applications that truly stand out.`,

        This powerful library allows developers to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces with ease, 
        but it can also be complex to learn. I turned to free online resources and YouTube videos to 
        learn the basics of React, and gradually built up my skills over time. From understanding React's 
        virtual DOM to utilizing state and props, I persevered in my journey to mastering React. Now, I am 
        able to use this powerful library to build scalable and maintainable applications that truly stand out.`,

        learn about media queries, responsive typography, and more. I also learned about the importance of 
        creating websites that are accessible and easy to use for all users, regardless of their device or 
        accessibility needs. Now, I am able to create stunning and functional designs that work on any device

        content: `As a front end engineer, I knew that I needed to learn how 
                to work with APIs in order to build truly dynamic and interactive 
                web applications. But APIs can be complex, with their own unique 
                syntax and protocols. I turned to free online resources and YouTube 
                videos to learn about RESTful APIs, AJAX, and more. I learned how 
                to integrate data from external sources into my web applications, 
                creating seamless and responsive user experiences. I also learned 
                about the importance of security and authentication when working 
                with APIs. Now, I am able to create web applications that integrate 
                data from a variety of sources, providing users with the information 
                they need in a fast and efficient manner.`,
